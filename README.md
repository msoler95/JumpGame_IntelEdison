Jump Game is an Intel Edison game based on the idea of jumping all monsters that are coming to eat you. 

Every level has his own screen color and difficulty. If an obstacle eats you, you'll lose the game. 

How many levels can you reach? 

This project has been done just for fun and discover the posibilities of the Intel Edison.
